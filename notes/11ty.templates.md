### Q: What is a good 11ty template for project blogging?
**Date:** 2026-02-12

## Top Recommendations

### 1. eleventy-base-blog (Recommended)
https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog

The **official 11ty starter blog**. Minimal, uses Eleventy v3, produces zero client-side JavaScript, and is well-maintained by the 11ty team. Features:
- Blog post collections with tags
- RSS feed
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Clean, simple layout you can customize

Best match for blogging gap reports, Q&A logs, and project updates from `docs/`.

### 2. eleventy-high-performance-blog
https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog

Built by a Google engineer, perfect 100/100 Lighthouse scores. More opinionated but great for responsive images, inlined CSS, and a service worker.

### 3. 11ty + Tailwind + Vite starter
https://github.com/ttntm/11ty-tailwind-alpine

Modern styling with Tailwind CSS and hot-reload dev experience via Vite. More tooling overhead but nicer to style.

## Recommendation

Go with **eleventy-base-blog**. Simplest path:

```bash
npx degit 11ty/eleventy-base-blog metagen-blog
```

Adjust its `eleventy.config.js` to point `input` at the `docs/` directory and set up collections for reports and Q&A log. It already handles markdown with front matter, tagging, and navigation.

The other starters add complexity (Tailwind, Vite, CMS integrations) that aren't needed for a project dev blog.
