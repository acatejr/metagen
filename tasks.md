1. Build an application that uses AI or an LLM to automatically build the metadata for a  geospatial data set.  The input data set could be a shapefile or a personal geodatabase or a feature layer in a geospatial database like postgis.  The output metadata might be of varying standards like FGDC, CSDGM, DCAT, ISO-19115.  Provide instructions and examples on how the app would be used both for local file system data sources and for connecting to a spatial data set that is in an enterprise geodatabase like PostgreSQL, Oracle Spatial, or even sqlite.
